//get the canvas from html

//each square/canvas grid should be 20x20 px

//get the context of canvas to get methods and properties and allow use in JS

//draw rectangle 

//set positions 

//set sizes 

//set strokes 

//since each square on each shape is 20 px as well as the grid we can set a var/const for sqaures instead of counting 20px

//the game board is 10x20 squares

//create the board using an array and loops to make each row and collum

//if a square is in the top left it will be at board[0][0] bottom right will be [19][9] this method should be fastest

//to control the shapes and rotations you should create 3x3 squares using arrays and set the ones not being used to empty while the squares with actual squares in it should be set to 1, the rotation axis should obviously be in the center

//like dario sudgested make an array inside an array for every shape
