# 8-bit-Games

This site was created as a final project for course 201 Code Fellows syllabus run by Source Code and hosted in Ten Habitat, in Barbados. Team members include Ricardo Collymore and Maria-Elena Farmer. More about these developers can be found on the About Us page complete with links to other github repositories. 

The purpose of 8-bit games is to bring back some of the old (mainly arcade-style) games that everyone loves, and give easy access, so you can play any time! We have learnt a lot while working on this together and greatly improved our debugging skills!

Please enjoy the games!
